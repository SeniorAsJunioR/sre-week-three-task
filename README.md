#### Mi Respuesta a la Task 2: From Perplexity


To address the toil in the ticketing system, several potential solutions or products can be considered. These include:

1. IT Ticketing Software: IT Ticketing Software is a cost-effective solution that reduces overheads associated with traditional service management. It automates and optimizes processes, which curtails operational costs and mitigates the risks of errors and delays. IT Ticketing Software is engineered with robust security protocols and complies with regulatory standards, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data[1].
2. Closed-Loop Security with Ticketing System Integration: This solution ensures a closed-loop management and automated workflow for processing security incidents and tracking their status throughout the mitigation process. It offers flexible architecture that works with deployed ticketing or service desk software such as Jira, ServiceNow, and others. It allows the ability to customize notifications per customer’s workflow and offers bi-directional communications for creating/updating service desk tickets. This solution ensures that issues are indeed resolved before tickets are closed[2].
3. ITSM Software: ITSM software can connect users with approved resolutions before an unnecessary IT ticket is created. It can also determine which tickets get handled first, ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly. ITSM software can also build and maintain a knowledge base, which helps reduce resolution times for similar tickets[5].
4. Segmenting Support Tickets: Larger IT service desk teams depend on accurately segmented IT support tickets to consistently meet SLAs. Segmenting support tickets ensures that incident reports or service requests that pertain to a particular technology or stage are routed differently, decreasing first response times and improving overall ticket handling[5].
5. Empowering Support Staff: IT ticket handling software systems can help support staff stay organized and reduce costs and frustration. This is achieved by ensuring that IT agents receive tickets with accurate and up-to-date information, correctly filled out by the customer, and maintaining a robust knowledge base where they can reference similar cases and make updates when they learn new information[5].
6. Providing a Historical View: Providing a historical view of a ticket as it moves through the service desk and through escalations can save the customer from re-explaining the issue to several IT support workers throughout the ticket-handling process. This improves the customer experience and is among the benefits of IT ticket handling best practices[5].
7. Following the Data: IT organizations striving for service excellence must “follow the data.” The first step toward improving IT ticket handling is to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average response time, average resolution time, average overall ticket handling time, ticket escalation rates, self-service usage rates, and SLA attainment[5].

These solutions can help mitigate issues such as recurring obsolete alerts and lack of prioritization in the ticketing system. They are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ticketing system, ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly and that the customer experience is improved.
